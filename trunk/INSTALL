Installing qTip is relatively straight forward. Simply include the both the jQuery and qTip library files e.g. jquery-qtip-1.0.0.min.js using script html element(s), like so:

<script type="text/javascript" src="/projects/qtip/js/jquery.1.3.2.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/projects/qtip/js/jquery.qtip-1.0.min.js"></script>

Notice the jQuery library is included before qTip. This is _absolutely essential_ for correct functioning of the library and its accompanying methods.

It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that all JavaScript includes like the one above be placed after all your content at the footer of the page, just before the end </body> tag. This ensures that all content is loaded before manipulation of the DOM occurs.
